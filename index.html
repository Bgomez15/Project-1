         <p> My name is Brayan Gomez, I'm based in San Francisco and I'm a digital artist. I'm half Mexican and half Salvadoran. As I previously stated, I was born and raised in San Francisco and it's the place I love to be in. My art usually centers itself around the city and regaining childhood memories and colors. I'm a huge fan of music and I love listening to almost anything out there. I would consider myself to be pretty open minded and ready to learn new things. As a current San Francisco State student, I'm persuing a BS in Visual Communication Design, something that will put my experiene with art and media to new heights. I've developed an interest in photography and I hope to transfer some of my creative output into this form of expression. I like collecting physical madia as my hobby, an example of this are music CDs and I love sketching as well as playing videogames. I have a passion for designing things because I like making things that others can use and be able to witness someone's life be improved. This is why I chose this path and this is why I hope i can succeed in it.</p>
