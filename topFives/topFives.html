            <p>The PlayStation Vita is often considered a lesser version of it's predecessor, the PlayStation Portable. I consider this console to be the best because of its amazing catalogue and huge potential for a gamer. The console has many games that are exclusive to this small device as well as some games that were only ported to the Nintendo Switch many years after. It also has games from the PlayStation 4 catalogue, and the best of all is that it is all in a small devide that can fit right into your pocket. The modding capabilities are also impressive for such a compact device and was truly ahead of it's time.  </p>
            <a href="https://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps3/current/index.html"><h2><li>PlayStation 3</li></h2></a>
            <br>
            <img src="img/ps3.jpg" alt="A black PlayStation 3 console with a black controller on top of it">
            <p>The reason to why the PlayStation 3 is so high up this list is probably because of it's nostalgic factor. This was the first console I ever had apart from a Nintendo DS and I was amazed by what this console could do. When compared to the graphics I was used to at the time, this console was miles ahead. I have many memories with this console including playing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and many other games that still somewhat stand the test of time</p>
            <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/consoles"><h2><li>Xbox One</li></h2></a>
            <br>
            <img src="img/xboxOne.jpg" alt="A black Xbox One console with a black controller in front of it">
            <p>The Xbox One comes i third place because of it's great catalogue and superior capability and performance than its sister console, the PlayStation 4. This console had great exclusive titles as well as backwards compatibility with some amazing Xbox 360 games. This console also happens to have my favorite controller of all time, there is something about it's design that makes it extremly comfortable and fun to use. I still make use of the controller after 10 even if it's on a PC</p>
            <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps4/?smcid=pdc%3Aen-us%3Aprimary%20nav%3Amsg-ps4%3Aconsole"><h2><li>PlayStation 4</li></h2></a>
            <img src="img/ps4.jpg" alt="A black PlayStation 4 console in an vertical position with a black controller in front of it">
            <p>The PlayStation 4 was my second console right after the PlayStation 3 and I was amazed by this console, just not as much as the PlayStation 3. I think this console has the best exclusives on any console yet fell behind in ergonomics for me. With this said, it is still an amazing console that has some of my all-time favorite games on it.</p>
            <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/switch/"><h2><li>Nintendo Switch</li></h2></a>
            <br>
            <img src="img/switch.jpg" alt="A grey Nintendo Switch console with grey Joy-Con controllers attarched to it">
            <p>The last console on this list is the Nintendo Switch, not because it was bad but because it was simply the least interesting visually to me. I also really dislike the Joy-Cons since stick drifting is very ccommon for this console. The saving point for this console is how it can be many things with a single device as well as it's huge catalogue of games.</p>

            <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/uncharted/"><h2><li>Uncharted 2</li></h2></a>
            <br>
            <img src="img/uncharted2.jpg" alt="A screenshot of Uncharted 2 showing the main character, Nathan Drake, being strangled by a soilder while holding a gun">
            <p>This game was the highest point in the Uncharted franchise, with an great balance of goof storytelling and over-the-top action. Responsive controls and great characters that never feel one-dimensional or stale. The story remains entertaining throughout the game and it's a great game from the PlayStation 3 era.</p>
            <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/god-of-war-ragnarok/"><h2><li>God of War Ragnarok</li></h2></a>
            <br>
            <img src="img/godOfWar.jpg" alt="A screenshot of Gof of War Ragnarok main character, Kratos, powering up an attack with the leviathan axe">
            <p>Having recently completed this game I can say it's story, while with some pacing issues, is a very good story that ends the Norse saga in a high note for the franchise as a whole. I'm excited to see where the series decides to take it's main character.</p>
            <a href="https://atlus.com/persona5/"><h2><li>Persona 5</li></h2></a>
            <br>
            <img src="img/persona5.jpg" alt="Artwork of Persona 5 main character, Joker, with his signature mask and coat along with the rest of the Phantom Thieves">
            <p>While being a long game with about 120 hours to complete, Persona 5 maintains the entertainment by having addictive turn-based combat and a great cast of characters. The story can feel like a slow-burner but it is totally worth the wait. As with God of War Ragnarok, i'm excited to see what they do with the sixth game of the franchise.</p>
            <a href="www.halowaypoint.com/"><h2><li>Halo 3</li></h2></a>
            <br>
            <img src="img/halo3.jpeg" alt="Artwork of Halo 3 showing the Master Chief holding his assault rifle and the Arbiter holding an energy sword">
            <p>This is the last Halo game made by its original studio before being given to 343 Industries. The end to the original trilogy is the best way the story could have ended. This is peak Halo and nothing that came after it has come close to the greatness of this game.</p>
            <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/"><h2><li>Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</li></h2></a>
            <br>
            <img src="img/cod4.jpg" alt="The cover art of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare showing one of the main characters holding an M4A1 along with two other soilders and two helicopters in the background">
            <p>This was one of the first Call of Duty games and games overall that I managed to get my hands on. This was the first Call of Duty game to introduce the formula that has been rinsed and repeated for over a decade now, but this was the best version of such.</p>
