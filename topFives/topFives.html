            <a href="https://shop.my-gnx.com/"><h2><li>Kendrick Lamar</li></h2></a>
            <br>
            <div class="kendrick">
            <img src="img/Kendrick.jpg" alt="The album cover for Kendrick Lamar's GNX album showcasing a black GNX car with Kendrick Lamar leaning on the back of the car">

            </div>
            <p>The best artist in my opinion would have to be Kendrick Lamar. Not because he is what is currently "trendy" since i've been listening to his music since his 2015 album 'To Pimp A Butterfly' but because of the depth everything he does has. From the music and production to the visuals, everything has a purpose and a meaning. I really enjoy listening to his discography because there is something for almost everything one can ask for, from slow grooves to upbeat music, it's all there. I also admire the cultural impact he's had with his music, something he continues to do today and will continue to as long as he continues his music career. I must also add that I really like his fashion since about 2022.</p>

            <a href="https://awge.com/"><h2><li>A$AP ROCKY</li></h2></a>
            <br>
            <div class="rocky">
            <img src="img/B.png" alt="A design of an abstract metalic shape with sharp edges">
            <img src="img/rocky.jpg" alt="An alternative album cover for A$AP Rocky's album 'Testing' where he is standing on top of a destoyed car while facing upwards and screaming with a yellow and black logo as well as the title of the artist and album">
            </div>
            <p>My second favorite artist is A$AP Rocky. While he has not been making as much music as he did in the early 2010s, his fashion style is on a different level. I really like his style and the precense be brings with everything and everywhere he is. His music doesn't fall short from this, Rocky's music can be described as a trip. He's an influencial artist, bringing Cloud Rap to mainstream and setting the stage for artists in the late 2010s such as Playboi Carti. His sound is spacy and moody but layed back and calm while also flowing in a way that doesn't get stale. A$AP is often overlooked as one of the most influencial artists of the 2010s, something I hope changes with time.  </p>

            <a href="https://www.kaliuchis.com/"><h2><li>Kali Uchis</li></h2></a>
            <br>
            <div class="kali">
            <img src="img/kali.jpg" alt="A photoshoot of artist Kali Uchis posing in front of a Yellow background">
            <img src="img/D.png" alt="A design of an abstract metalic shape with sharp edges">
            </div>
            <p>Kali Uchis is a very interesting artist with a sweet and captivating voice that never fails to put you on a mood. While earlier works did not have as much direction as her more recent projects do, I consider her music to be tasteful and wears her roots proudly. I really like her album "Orquideas" where she dove deeper into her Latin roots and I would say she succeeded in doing so. Her dreamy aesthetic is also something to take note of since that is something that has carried on throughout time. I place her as a third place because she had a rocky start to her career in my opinion yet has been getting better with each project she puts out.</p>

            <a href="https://store.fkatwigsofficial.com/"><h2><li>FKA Twigs</li></h2></a>
            <div class="fka">
            <img src="img/E.png" alt="A design of an abstract metalic shape with sharp edges">
            <img src="img/fka.jpg" alt="A photoshoot of artist FKA Twigs shot during a concert">
            </div>
            <p>My fourth favorite artist is FKA Twigs. I don't have as much time listening to her as I do with the other artists in this list. My introduction has been fairly recent with her newest album 'Eusexua'. Even if the introduction was not long ago, she quickly became one of my favorite artists because of how experimental she is with her music. She does not conform to the norms of her musical genre and always takes it to places you wouldn't think of. I have recently listened to most of her discography and it's great for the most part. I won't put her higher on my list because of the time I have listening to her but i'm sure she will be higher soon. </p>

            <a href="https://www.travisscott.com/"><h2><li>Travis Scott</li></h2></a>
            <br>
            <div class="travis">
            <img src="img/travis.jpg" alt="A photoshoot of artist Travis Scott during a concert which showcases the artist with a black outfit and white sunglasses while screaming">
            <img src="img/lk.png" alt="A design of an abstract metalic shape with round edges">
            </div>
            <p>My number five pick is Travis Scott. I put him this low on the list because of his recent work, I believe his move into mainstream caused him to lose some of what made him stand out before. While his most recent album 'Utopia' goes for a much more unconventional and experimental sound, there is still something missing that simply cannot be recreated from his past work. I really love his early work such as 'Days Before Rodeo' and 'Rodeo' but I consider 'Astroworld' to be his worst album. This is because of the little effort he put into trying to make it a different album and instead capitalize on features and older work. What makes him stand out, even in his worst projects, is always the production and that is something I will always enjoy from his music.</p>

            <a href="https://gagosianshop.com/collections/takashi-murakami"><h2><li>Superflat</li></h2></a>
            <br>
            <div class="superflat">
            <img src="img/nb.png" alt="A design of an abstract metalic shape  with round edges">
            <img src="img/superflat.jpg" alt="Artwork made by Takashi Murakami depicting many abstract faces and flowers with a variety of colors that make hard contrasts with one another in an cartoon style">
            </div>
            <p>I really like this art style because of the commentary it provides on consumerism and modern pop culture. It serves as commentary on the current economic and cultural status of Japanese culture while at the same time providing amazing art that is a mix of pop art with traditional art in a way that is mind bending and child-like. This is one of my main inspirations in my art and I'm a huge fan of all artists that come from this movement.</p>


            <a href="https://pixeljoint.com/pixels/new_icons.asp?ob=showcase"><h2><li>Pixel Art</li></h2></a>
            <br>
            <div class="pixel">
            <img src="img/pixel.jpg" alt="Artwork in pixrl art style showcasing a scenery that includes a japanese city as well as a torii gate">
            <img src="img/ww.png" alt="An abstract metalic shape with sharp edges">
            </div>
            <p>While I don't know how to do pixel art, I really like it and appreciate it everytime I see it. I first knew about it from videogames and it never fails to make me appreciate it in different ways. I really like how mindful you have to be about the placement of things since you only have a set amount of pixels you can work with. I also admire how charismatic the artstyle can be even and how detailed some people can make it look. I think this is a beautiful artstyle that is underrated by the art community outside of videogames.</p>

            <a href="https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/16183476"><h2><li>Fajyobore</li></h2></a>
            <br>
            <div class="faj">
            <img src="img/X.png" alt="An abstract metalic shape with sharp edges">
            <img src="img/faj.png" alt="Artwork from artist Fajyobore showcasing a anime character turning their back towards the image while looking back with vivid red eyes and holding a dagger in each hand">
            </div>
            <p>I discovered this artist through Instagram and decided to do an art study on them. I especially like how this artist makes use of lighting and shadows since they make Anime characters seem much more grounded and almost realistic with the way the lighting is handled. I take inspiration from this artist mostly because of that reason but the composition as well. They are able to create scenes that feel like they've been pulled out of a movie and that's amazing to see.</p>

            <a href="img/mika.jpg"><h2><li>Mika Pikazo</li></h2></a>
            <br>
            <div class="mika">
            <img src="img/mika.jpg" alt="Arwork from artist Mika Pikazo showcasing a anime character with many visual effects and colors surrounding the face of the character over a blue background">
            <img src="img/XY.png" alt="An abstract metalic shape with sharp edges">
            </div>
            <p>I discovered Mika Pikazo through YouTube when scrolling through my recommended videos. I especially like how they use textures and how they handle post-processing effects for their art and it really showed me that post-processing can be overlooked a lot. I really like the crazy popping color selection they do since that is also something that makes this artist stand out with vivid and hard contrasting colors. The attention to detail in the eyes is also something worth mentioning since they can be a piece of art themselves.</p>

            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bwy_art/?hl=en"><h2><li>BwyArt</li></h2></a>
            <br>
            <div class="bwyart">
            <img src="img/untitled.png" alt="An abstract metalic shape with sharp edges">
            <img src="img/bwyart.jpg" alt="Artwork by BwyArt showcasing a woman holding a knife made in a painting style">
            </div>
            <p>This remains an ispiration and also as a progress check of where I am as an artist and where I want to be someday in terms of my skill. This artist makes perfect use of digital art while still making it look like a painting. I've done multiple art studies on this artist's work but I cannot seem to understand how they do it. It's amazing and I know that everyone can also appreciate the level of artistry this person has.</p>
